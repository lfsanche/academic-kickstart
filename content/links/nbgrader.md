- [long way - not useful](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)

## My way

1. Install nbgrader

```jupyter notebook

> var foo = 'bar';

```
2. Create a folder where you would like to store your course material (e.g. course1)

3. Open Anaconda Powershell Prompt and change directory

```cmd

> var foo = 'bar';

```
